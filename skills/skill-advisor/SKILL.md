# Skill Advisor — Allura-Native Recommendation Engine

Analyzes the current task and recommends which skills, hooks, and governance policies to activate. Learns from Allura Brain execution history to improve recommendations over time.

## When This Fires

- User starts a new task and hasn't loaded skills yet
- User asks "what skills should I use?" or "which hooks apply?"
- User seems unsure which tools to reach for
- Beginning of any `/auto`, `/party`, or `/orchestrate` workflow
- Any prompt containing "suggest", "recommend", "advise", "what do I need"

## Protocol

### Step 1: Understand the Task

Extract from the current conversation or `$ARGUMENTS`:
- **Task type**: implementation, debugging, refactoring, architecture, testing, deployment, documentation, research, review
- **Domain**: frontend, backend, database, infrastructure, security, memory, agents
- **Scope**: single file, multi-file, cross-module, epic
- **Risk level**: read-only analysis, code modification, schema change, deployment

### Step 2: Search Brain for History

Query Allura Brain for past executions matching this task type:

```javascript
allura-brain_memory_search({
  query: "<task type> skills used success patterns",
  group_id: "allura-system",
  limit: 10
})

allura-brain_memory_search({
  query: "<domain> hooks policies governance",
  group_id: "allura-system",
  limit: 5
})
```

Extract from results:
- Which skills were active during successful completions of similar tasks
- Which skills were NOT loaded but would have helped (failure patterns)
- Any SONA patterns with `suggestedAgent` data for this task type

### Step 3: Match Against Installed Skills

Scan the installed skill catalog:

```bash
# List all installed skills
ls -d .opencode/skills/*/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null
```

For each skill, read the frontmatter `name` and `description` fields. Score relevance against the current task using keyword overlap and Brain history data.

### Step 4: Identify Applicable Hooks

Check which governance hooks are relevant to this task:

| Task Signal | Hook / Policy |
|-------------|--------------|
| Touches database / SQL / schema | `group_id` enforcement, append-only events |
| Modifies agent definitions | HITL curator approval required |
| Changes environment / config | Destructive change gate |
| Calls MCP tools | MCP-only DB access policy |
| Writes to Neo4j | SUPERSEDES versioning required |
| Promotes memory | Curator approval (confidence >= 0.85) |
| Performance-sensitive path | Coherence monitor active |

### Step 5: Present Recommendations

Output a structured recommendation:

```markdown
## Skill Advisor — Recommendations

**Task:** <one-line summary>
**Type:** <task type> | **Domain:** <domain> | **Risk:** <low/medium/high>

### Skills to Load

| Priority | Skill | Why |
|----------|-------|-----|
| **P0** | <skill-name> | <reason — what it gives you for this task> |
| **P1** | <skill-name> | <reason> |
| **P2** | <skill-name> | <reason> |

### Active Hooks & Policies

| Policy | Status | Applies Because |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| group_id enforcement | Active | <reason or "not applicable"> |
| Append-only events | Active | <reason or "not applicable"> |
| HITL curator approval | Active | <reason or "not applicable"> |
| SUPERSEDES versioning | Active | <reason or "not applicable"> |
| Destructive change gate | Active | <reason or "not applicable"> |
| MCP-only DB access | Active | <reason or "not applicable"> |

### Agent Routing

| Recommended Agent | Role | Why |
|-------------------|------|-----|
| <agent-name> | <role> | <reason — SONA history or default routing> |

### Brain Context

<summary of relevant past work found in Brain — what succeeded, what failed, what to watch for>
```

Only include policies that are actually relevant — don't list all 6 if only 2 apply. Keep the output scannable.

### Step 6: Log Recommendation

Write the recommendation to Brain so future queries benefit:

```javascript
allura-brain_memory_add({
  group_id: "allura-system",
  user_id: "skill-advisor",
  content: "SKILL_RECOMMENDATION: task=<type>, skills=[<list>], agent=<recommended>",
  metadata: {
    source: "skill-advisor",
    event_type: "SKILL_RECOMMENDATION",
    task_type: "<type>",
    skills_recommended: ["<skill1>", "<skill2>"],
    agent_recommended: "<agent>",
    brain_hits: <number of relevant Brain results>
  }
})
```

## How It Learns

The advisor improves over time through three signals:

1. **SONA trajectories** — When a task succeeds with certain skills loaded, that pairing is reinforced in pattern extraction
2. **Recommendation logging** — Every recommendation is logged to Brain with the task type and skill list
3. **Outcome correlation** — Pattern extraction detects which skill combinations correlate with success vs failure

After enough data accumulates, the advisor stops relying on keyword matching and starts using empirical evidence: "tasks like this succeed 90% of the time with code-review + systematic-debugging loaded."

## Rules

1. **Brain first** — always search before recommending
2. **Relevant only** — don't dump the full catalog, pick 3-5 skills max
3. **Policies matter** — always surface applicable governance hooks
4. **Log everything** — recommendations feed the learning loop
5. **Graceful degradation** — if Brain is unavailable, fall back to keyword-based matching against the skill catalog
6. **group_id: allura-system** — on every Brain operation
