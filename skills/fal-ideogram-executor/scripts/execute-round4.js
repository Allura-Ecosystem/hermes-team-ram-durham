    prompt: `A sophisticated logo design for "Allura Memory" featuring a wordmark partially enclosed by an architectural frame with intentional openings. The frame has softened corners with gentle curves where geometry meets open space — the Lover's touch. Deep graphite (#1C232B) and slate (#405261) color palette with subtle warmth. The design balances Sage clarity (structured, inspectable) with Lover grace (sensory elegance, magnetic refinement). The frame is incomplete, suggesting memory with visible boundaries and review. Typography is refined and precise, with optical kerning that feels crafted. No neon, no glowing effects, no cyberpunk, no decorative swirls. The mark should feel like knowledge under control made with enough care that you're drawn toward it — the thin magic of exceptional craft. Minimal, architectural, graceful curves within geometric containment.`,

The mark shows graceful curves at geometric intersections — softened edges that signal warmth without sacrificing structure. Deep graphite (#1C232B) on clean white, with Steel Blue (#4E6E8A) accents for measured emphasis. The typography feels precise yet inviting, with proportions that make you want to look closer. The design embodies the "thin magic" — craft so refined it borders on enchanting. No princess-soft femininity, no pastel washes, no decorative ornamentation. This is architectural grace: beauty born from structure, not decoration. Sage clarity meets Lover elegance meets Ruler containment.`,

The geometric form features softened corners and graceful curves where lines meet open space. Deep graphite (#1C232B) with subtle warmth. The mark should feel architectural yet inviting — precise enough to signal structure, graceful enough to feel magnetic. No literal memory cliches (no brains, no nodes, no circuits). No decorative flourishes. The Lover archetype enters through refined proportions and sensory elegance — the thin magic of exceptional craft. Icon should work at small sizes (16px to 512px) while maintaining clarity and grace.`,
