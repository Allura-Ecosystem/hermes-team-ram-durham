# Dev Loop — Implement, Review, Retro, Repeat

A self-correcting development loop that drives stories to done by chaining three BMad skills with Context7 research and **Allura Brain memory at every phase**. Each story benefits from what the previous stories learned. Runs in a single session, Ralph-style.

## Why Allura matters here

Without memory, story 3 repeats the same mistakes as story 1. The dev loop writes structured traces after every phase — research findings, implementation decisions, review patterns, fix strategies — so that each subsequent story starts with the accumulated wisdom of the session. Across sessions, Brain retains what worked and what didn't, making the loop faster every time it runs.

## The Loop (with Brain reads/writes)

## Allura Governance Contract

These rules apply to every Brain operation in the loop. They're not optional — the governance-preflight hook enforces them.

### Tenant & Identity

Resolve the project's `group_id` from `{project-root}/my-project/policies/allura-tenant.md` or AGENTS.md. Default: `allura-system`. For Mortgate: `allura-mortgage`.

Use the appropriate `user_id` per phase:

| Phase | Agent Identity | Role |
|-------|---------------|------|
| Hydration / Advance | `brooks-architect-{project}` | Orchestrator |
| Research | `scout-recon-{project}` | Research |
| Implement | `woz-builder-{project}` | Builder |
| Review | `pike-interface-review-{project}` | Reviewer |
| Retrospective | `brooks-architect-{project}` | Synthesis |

### Memory Content Taxonomy

Use structured prefixes so memories are searchable and filterable:

| Prefix | When | Example |
|--------|------|---------|
| `RESEARCH:` | Context7 finding worth persisting | `RESEARCH: LWC wire adapters require @salesforce/apex import, not @wire directly. Source: Context7 lwc docs.` |
| `DECISION:` | Implementation choice with rationale | `DECISION: US-1.1 orchestrator uses CustomEvent not pubsub — simpler, no shared state needed.` |
| `REVIEW_PATTERN:` | Recurring review finding | `REVIEW_PATTERN: Focus outlines missing on new interactive elements. Seen in US-1.1 and US-1.3.` |
| `FIX_STRATEGY:` | How a review finding was resolved | `FIX_STRATEGY: Missing focus rings — add :focus-visible with project's standard 2px charcoal outline.` |
| `STORY_COMPLETE:` | Story outcome trace | `STORY_COMPLETE: US-1.1 — orchestrator built. 6-screen state machine, 4 Jest tests. Files: ...` |
| `BLOCKER:` | Unresolved issue | `BLOCKER: US-1.5 chrome removal requires org access — cannot verify without mortgate-de.` |
| `LESSON:` | Retrospective insight | `LESSON: Starting with Jest tests (US-1.3) before orchestrator would have caught the event contract gap earlier.` |

### Invariants

1. **Brain-first.** Search before every story, not just at activation.
2. **Write after every phase** that produces a non-trivial finding.
3. **Append-only.** Never update or delete existing memories.
4. **HITL for promotion.** If a lesson's confidence ≥ 0.85, propose promotion — don't auto-promote.
5. **Degrade gracefully.** If Brain is unreachable, continue the loop with a `[DEGRADED]` flag and log what would have been written.

---

## On Activation

### 1. Discover tenant and work queue

Read the project's Allura tenant config to get `group_id` and agent identities. Then discover the story queue:

- Sprint-status file → stories with `ready-for-dev` or `in-progress`
- Story files directory → sort by number
- User-specified single story

### 2. Epic-level Brain hydration

Search Brain for the big picture before showing the queue:

```
allura-brain__memory_search(
  query: "<epic name> architecture decisions blockers patterns",
  group_id: "<tenant>",
  limit: 10
)
```

This surfaces lessons from prior sessions, blockers from prior stories, and review patterns that recurred. Summarize anything relevant under the queue announcement.

### 3. Announce and confirm

```
Dev Loop — EP-1 (3 stories queued)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[ ] US-1.1  Onboarding orchestrator
[ ] US-1.3  Jest tests for untested LWCs
[ ] US-1.7  HITL decision promotion

Brain: 3 prior memories found (1 pattern, 1 decision, 1 blocker)
Context7: enabled
Retro: after all stories

Start? [Y/n]
```

---

## Phase 0: STORY-LEVEL BRAIN HYDRATION

**Before every story**, search Brain for context specific to this story's domain:

```
allura-brain__memory_search(
  query: "<story_id> <story domain keywords> blockers decisions review patterns",
  group_id: "<tenant>",
  limit: 5
)
```

Also search for Context7 research from prior sessions on the same tech:

```
allura-brain__memory_search(
  query: "RESEARCH: <technology the story uses>",
  group_id: "<tenant>",
  limit: 3
)
```

**Carry forward:** Compile a brief for the implementation phase:
- Prior decisions that constrain this story
- Review patterns to avoid (e.g., "last 3 stories had missing focus rings — check proactively")
- Cached Context7 findings that save a re-lookup
- Known blockers to watch for

---

## Phase 1: RESEARCH (Context7)

Before implementing, check if the story needs current documentation. **Check Brain first** — if a prior session already looked up the same library/topic, you may not need Context7 at all.

**When to research:**
- Story mentions a library, API, or framework you're not current on
- Story involves a pattern not in the codebase
- Story references version-specific behavior

**How:**
```bash
curl -s "https://context7.com/api/v2/libs/search?libraryName=LIBRARY&query=TOPIC" | jq '.results[0]'
curl -s "https://context7.com/api/v2/context?libraryId=LIBRARY_ID&query=TOPIC&type=txt"
```

**Brain write (if finding is non-trivial):**

If Context7 returns something that changes how you'd implement the story — a gotcha, a deprecation, a new API signature — persist it:

```
allura-brain__memory_add(
  group_id: "<tenant>",
  user_id: "scout-recon-<project>",
  content: "RESEARCH: <library> <topic> — <key finding in 1-2 sentences>. Source: Context7.",
  metadata: { source: "conversation", agent_id: "scout-recon-<project>" }
)
```

Skip the write if the finding is trivial or already in project docs. The goal is to avoid re-looking up the same thing in future sessions.

---

## Phase 2: IMPLEMENT (bmad-dev-story)

Invoke the `bmad-dev-story` workflow. Carry the hydration brief and Context7 findings into the implementation.

1. Read story file completely — acceptance criteria, tasks, dependencies, test plan.
2. Read relevant project docs (BLUEPRINT, DESIGN, DATA-DICTIONARY, existing patterns).
3. Red-green-refactor: failing test → minimal code → refactor.
4. Update story file: tasks, dev notes, file list, change log.
5. Run tests. All must pass.
6. Mark story as `review`.

**Brain write (significant decisions only):**

If you made a non-obvious implementation choice, record it:

```
allura-brain__memory_add(
  group_id: "<tenant>",
  user_id: "woz-builder-<project>",
  content: "DECISION: <story_id> — <what you chose and why, in 1 sentence>.",
  metadata: { source: "conversation", agent_id: "woz-builder-<project>" }
)
```

Don't write trivial decisions. Good candidates: architectural pattern choices, library selection, workarounds for platform limitations, deviations from the story spec with rationale.

**On HALT:** If you hit a hard blocker, write it to Brain before stopping:

```
content: "BLOCKER: <story_id> — <what's blocked and why>."
```

---

## Phase 3: REVIEW (bmad-code-review)

Invoke `bmad-code-review` against the changes. Before reviewing, **check Brain for recurring patterns** from this session:

```
allura-brain__memory_search(
  query: "REVIEW_PATTERN FIX_STRATEGY",
  group_id: "<tenant>",
  limit: 5
)
```

If prior stories had a recurring finding (e.g., "missing focus rings"), proactively check for it before running the full review. This turns accumulated review knowledge into prevention.

**Review covers:** correctness, regressions, security, contract drift, missing tests.

**Brain write (recurring findings):**

If a finding matches something seen in a prior story, it's a pattern — persist it:

```
allura-brain__memory_add(
  group_id: "<tenant>",
  user_id: "pike-interface-review-<project>",
  content: "REVIEW_PATTERN: <finding> — seen in <story_ids>. Root cause: <explanation>.",
  metadata: { source: "conversation", agent_id: "pike-interface-review-<project>" }
)
```

### Fix Loop (max 3 cycles)

On Critical/High findings:
1. Fix the issues.
2. Re-run affected tests.
3. Re-review changed areas only.

**Brain write after successful fix:**
```
content: "FIX_STRATEGY: <pattern> — resolved by <what you did>. Apply to future stories proactively."
```

This is the highest-value Brain write in the loop — it turns review rework into reusable knowledge.

---

## Phase 4: ADVANCE

After review passes:

1. Mark story `done` in sprint-status and story file.
2. **Write the story outcome trace:**

```
allura-brain__memory_add(
  group_id: "<tenant>",
  user_id: "brooks-architect-<project>",
  content: "STORY_COMPLETE: <story_id> — <what shipped, 1 sentence>. Files: <list>. Review: <cycles> cycles. Key decision: <most important choice>.",
  metadata: { source: "conversation", agent_id: "brooks-architect-<project>" }
)
```

3. Update the queue display.
4. Loop back to Phase 0 for the next story.

---

## Phase 5: RETROSPECTIVE (bmad-retrospective)

When all stories are done, invoke `bmad-retrospective`. But first, **read back all memories written during this session** to feed the retro with structured data:

```
allura-brain__memory_search(
  query: "STORY_COMPLETE DECISION REVIEW_PATTERN FIX_STRATEGY BLOCKER",
  group_id: "<tenant>",
  user_id: "brooks-architect-<project>",
  limit: 20
)
```

The retro covers:
- What went well (patterns, tools, decisions that paid off)
- What didn't (blockers, rework, surprises)
- Lessons learned (carry forward)
- Action items with owners

**Brain write (lessons with promotion):**

For each lesson the retro surfaces, write it:

```
allura-brain__memory_add(
  group_id: "<tenant>",
  user_id: "brooks-architect-<project>",
  content: "LESSON: <insight, 1-2 sentences>. Evidence: <which stories demonstrated this>.",
  metadata: { source: "conversation", agent_id: "brooks-architect-<project>" }
)
```

If a lesson has high confidence (based on evidence from 2+ stories), **propose promotion** — don't auto-promote. Tell the user: "This lesson appeared in N stories. Recommend promoting to canonical memory. Approve?"

**Epic outcome trace:**
```
content: "EPIC_COMPLETE: <epic_id> — <N> stories shipped. Key lessons: <top 2-3>. Residual risks: <any>."
```

---

## Configuration

| Flag | Default | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| `skip-review` | false | Skip Phase 3 (no review gate) |
| `skip-retro` | false | Skip Phase 5 (no retrospective) |
| `skip-research` | false | Skip Phase 1 (no Context7) |
| `skip-brain` | false | Skip all Brain reads/writes (ungoverned mode) |
| `max-review-cycles` | 3 | Fix-and-re-review rounds before HALT |
| `single-story` | false | One story only, no retro |
| `epic` | auto | Target epic |

```
/dev-loop                          # full governed loop
/dev-loop US-1.3                   # single story
/dev-loop skip-brain               # ungoverned (no Brain reads/writes)
/dev-loop skip-research skip-retro # raw dev+review only
```

---

## HALT Conditions

1. Hard blocker (write `BLOCKER:` to Brain before stopping)
2. 3 failed review cycles
3. 3 failed implementation attempts
4. Test suite broken
5. User interruption

On HALT: show story, phase, blocker, and suggested next steps.

---

## What this skill is NOT

- **Not a subagent dispatcher.** Single-threaded. Use `bmad-sprint-loop` for parallel Team RAM.
- **Not a CI/CD pipeline.** Implements and reviews, doesn't deploy.
- **Not autonomous-forever.** User confirms at start, HALT conditions are sacred.
- **Not a Brain dump.** Only write memories that help future stories. Trivial observations stay in the conversation.

---

## Brain Memory Flow Summary

| Phase | Reads | Writes |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Activation | Epic context, prior lessons | — |
| Phase 0 (Hydration) | Story context, prior research, review patterns | — |
| Phase 1 (Research) | Prior Context7 lookups | `RESEARCH:` (non-trivial findings) |
| Phase 2 (Implement) | — (uses hydration brief) | `DECISION:` (significant choices), `BLOCKER:` (on halt) |
| Phase 3 (Review) | Prior `REVIEW_PATTERN:`, `FIX_STRATEGY:` | `REVIEW_PATTERN:` (recurring), `FIX_STRATEGY:` (after fix) |
| Phase 4 (Advance) | — | `STORY_COMPLETE:` (outcome trace) |
| Phase 5 (Retro) | All session traces | `LESSON:` (insights), `EPIC_COMPLETE:` (summary) |

**Total per story:** 2-3 reads, 2-4 writes (varies by complexity).
**Total per epic:** All of the above + retro reads/writes.
