# MCP Docker Memory System Skill

> **Architecture:** One runtime (MCP Docker Toolkit), one skill (this file), one path.
> **Runtime:** MCP Docker Toolkit registers and runs all MCP servers.
> **Skill:** This file tells Team Durham how and when to use those servers.
> **NEVER** duplicate the runtime layer. **NEVER** add a second MCP server entry for the same capability.

## Registered MCP Servers

| Server | Registered Via | Purpose | Status |
|--------|---------------|---------|--------|
| `database-server` | MCP Docker Toolkit | PostgreSQL read/write | ✅ Active |
| `neo4j-cypher` | MCP Docker Toolkit | Raw Cypher queries | ❌ Removed (AD-50) |
| `neo4j-memory` | MCP Docker Toolkit | Knowledge graph CRUD | ❌ Removed (AD-50) |
| `allura-brain` | MCP Docker Toolkit | 10 canonical memory ops | Use `allura-brain_memory_*` tools directly |

> **NOTE:** `allura-memory-mcp` Docker container is the backend service that MCP Docker's `allura-brain` routes to. It stays running but is NOT a second MCP server entry. One runtime, one registration.

## PostgreSQL — Episodic Memory

### Event Types

| Event Type | When to Use |
|------------|-------------|
| `AGENT_INVOKED` | When an agent starts a session |
| `AGENT_COMPLETED` | When an agent finishes successfully |
| `AGENT_FAILED` | When an agent encounters an error |
| `DESIGN_DECISION` | For strategic design decisions |
| `DDR_CREATED` | For major design decision records |
| `SKILL_PROPOSED` | When a new skill is proposed |
| `SKILL_APPROVED` | When a skill proposal is approved |
| `CLIENT_FEEDBACK` | When client feedback is routed |
| `BRAND_GUARDIAN_AUDIT` | Post-delivery compliance check |
| `TRADEMARK_SCREENED` | Name availability screening |
| `TASK_COMPLETE` | When a task is finished |
| `BLOCKED` | When progress is blocked |
| `LESSON_LEARNED` | For insights to remember |

### Insert Event Pattern

```javascript
MCP_DOCKER_insert_data({
  table_name: "events",
  columns: "event_type, group_id, agent_id, status, metadata",
  values: "'DESIGN_DECISION', 'allura-team-durham', 'aaker', 'completed', '{\"json\": \"summary\"}'"
})
```

### Query Pattern

```javascript
MCP_DOCKER_execute_sql({
  sql_query: "SELECT * FROM events WHERE group_id = 'allura-team-durham' AND agent_id = 'kotler' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10"
})
```

## Semantic Knowledge Graph

### When to use which server

| Need | Use | Why |
|------|-----|-----|
| Knowledge graph CRUD | `allura-brain_memory_*` | Entity/relation/observation operations |
| Brand Truth / promoted facts | `neo4j-memory` | Structured memory entities |

### Promotion Criteria (ALL must be true)

1. Decision is reusable across ≥2 projects
2. Decision was validated — not just proposed
3. No duplicate exists in the semantic knowledge graph

### Write Pattern (Always search first)

```javascript
// 1. Search first — never create duplicates
MCP_DOCKER_search_memories({ query: "decision text" })

// 2. Only create if no duplicate found
MCP_DOCKER_create_entities({
  entities: [{
    name: "Decision: Use MCP Docker as single runtime",
    type: "Decision",
    observations: [
      "One runtime layer (MCP Docker Toolkit) + one skill layer (.claude/skills/)",
      "No duplicate MCP server registrations for same capability",
      "Validated: 2026-04-21 architecture audit"
    ]
  }]
})
```

### Brand Truth Storage (Phase 6)

```javascript
MCP_DOCKER_create_entities({
  entities: [{
    name: "Brand: [Brand Name]",
    type: "Brand",
    observations: [
      "Archetype: Primary/Secondary",
      "Positioning: [statement]",
      "Promise: [brand promise]",
      "Project: [project name]",
      "group_id: allura-team-durham"
    ]
  }]
})

MCP_DOCKER_create_relations({
  relations: [{
    source: "Brand: [Brand Name]",
    target: "Project: [project name]",
    relationType: "PRODUCED_BY"
  }]
})
```

---

## Non-Overload Rules

1. **PostgreSQL** is for high-volume event logs (commands, builds, tests, every session action)
2. **The semantic knowledge graph** is for promoted memory only (ADRs, patterns, recurring failures + validated fixes)
3. **Batch writes:** At most **one** semantic graph write per completed task/decision
4. **De-duplicate:** **Search first**; only create if new
5. **Aggregate bursts** into a single "session checkpoint" insight

---

## Architecture Rule

**ONE runtime. ONE skill wrapper. ONE orchestration path.**

```
Team Durham Agent
    ↓
.claude/skills/mcp-docker-memory (this file)
    ↓
MCP Docker Toolkit (single runtime)
    ├── database-server → PostgreSQL :5432
    └── neo4j-memory   → Neo4j :7687
```

**NEVER add:**
- A second MCP server entry for the same DB
- An HTTP gateway wrapping an already-registered server
- A `docker exec` path bypassing MCP Docker
- Both `allura-memory` HTTP entry AND `allura-brain` MCP Docker entry

---

## Common Queries

### Last Session Event
```sql
SELECT * FROM events 
WHERE agent_id = 'kotler' AND group_id = 'allura-team-durham' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1
```

### Recent Decisions
```sql
SELECT * FROM events 
WHERE event_type IN ('DESIGN_DECISION', 'DDR_CREATED')
  AND group_id = 'allura-team-durham'
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10
```

### Pipeline Status
```sql
SELECT agent_id, event_type, status, created_at 
FROM events 
WHERE group_id = 'allura-team-durham'
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
```

---

## Invariants

- `group_id = 'allura-team-durham'` for ALL operations
- PostgreSQL events are **append-only** — never UPDATE or DELETE
- Semantic graph writes require **deduplication search first**
- At most **one semantic graph write per task**
- **NEVER use `docker exec`** — use MCP Docker tools only
- **NEVER register duplicate MCP servers** — one runtime, one skill, one path
