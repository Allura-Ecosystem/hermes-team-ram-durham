# Brand Strategy Skill

> **Executor:** @Aaker (Brand Strategist)
> **Type:** Strategy definition
> **group_id:** `allura-team-durham`

---

## Purpose

Define brand positioning, personality, promise, and proof points. This is the foundation that all other brand work builds on. **No creative work proceeds without a locked Strategy Pack.**

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Discover
- Query Allura Brain for existing brand truth
- Research competitive landscape via WebFetch
- Identify target audience and market positioning
- Interview stakeholders if needed

### Step 2: Define Brand Personality
Use Aaker's 5 Brand Personality Dimensions:

| Dimension | Traits | Best For |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Sincerity** | Down-to-earth, honest, wholesome, cheerful | Family brands, non-profits |
| **Excitement** | Daring, spirited, imaginative, up-to-date | Youth brands, tech startups |
| **Competence** | Reliable, intelligent, successful | B2B, professional services |
| **Sophistication** | Upper class, charming | Luxury, fashion, premium |
| **Ruggedness** | Outdoorsy, tough | Outdoor gear, automotive |

**Rule:** Lock on exactly 1-2 dimensions. Never more.

### Step 3: Articulate Brand Positioning
Use the STP framework:
- **Segmentation:** Who are the distinct market segments?
- **Targeting:** Which segment(s) will we serve?
- **Positioning:** How will we win in that space?

Positioning Statement Template:
```
For [target audience] who [need/frame of reference], 
[brand name] is a [category] that [point of difference] 
because [reason to believe].
```

### Step 4: Define Brand Promise
One sentence that captures what the brand delivers. Must be:
- Credible (backed by proof points)
- Differentiated (not generic)
- Ownable (unique to this brand)

### Step 5: Create Proof Points
3-5 evidence-based reasons the brand promise is credible:
- Facts, not aspirations
- Verifiable claims
- Specific, not vague

## Telemetry

Every invocation of this skill MUST log telemetry to the `events` table via MCP_DOCKER.
See `docs/TELEMETRY_SCHEMA.md` for the full schema.

### On Start

```javascript
MCP_DOCKER_insert_data({
  table_name: "events",
  columns: "event_type, group_id, agent_id, status, metadata",
  values: "'SKILL_USED', 'allura-team-durham', 'aaker', 'completed',
    '{\"skill_name\": \"brand-strategy\", \"phase\": 1, \"trigger\": \"<trigger phrase>\", \"prerequisites_met\": true}'"
})
```

### On Completion

```javascript
MCP_DOCKER_insert_data({
  table_name: "events",
  columns: "event_type, group_id, agent_id, status, metadata",
  values: "'SKILL_COMPLETED', 'allura-team-durham', 'aaker', 'completed',
    '{\"skill_name\": \"brand-strategy\", \"phase\": 1, \"duration_sec\": <N>, \"output_artifact_path\": \"<path>\", \"tool_calls\": [<tools used>]}'"
})
```

### On Failure

```javascript
MCP_DOCKER_insert_data({
  table_name: "events",
  columns: "event_type, group_id, agent_id, status, error_message, metadata",
  values: "'SKILL_FAILED', 'allura-team-durham', 'aaker', 'failed', '<error>',
    '{\"skill_name\": \"brand-strategy\", \"phase\": 1, \"missing_prerequisites\": [<items>], \"fallback_used\": false}'"
})
```

**Never skip telemetry logging.** If MCP_DOCKER_insert_data fails, log an error to the user and continue.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Trying to be everything** — "We're sincere AND exciting AND competent" ❌
2. **Vague positioning** — "For everyone who wants quality" ❌
3. **Aspirational proof points** — "We will be the best" ❌
4. **Generic voice** — "Professional yet approachable" ❌
5. **Skipping validation** — Moving to creative without locking ❌
